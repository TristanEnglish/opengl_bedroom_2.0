## Description

For this project, I modeled, lit, and textured a fully furnished bedroom in OpenGL 2.0!

Extra notes / things I'm especially proud of:
- The walls, door, and window disappear appropriately depending on view angle! This allows you to see the room at all angles without obstructions.
- I spent a lot of time on some more complex, non-cuboid objects! The lamps on the dresser and the luxo lamp on the desk proved to be a challenge, as I had to define individual vertices at every point in a cylinder.
- The penguins were created in my initial OpenGL assignments, and I couldn't bear to see them go! They were written in a function that allows you to specify the color of the penguin without effect on the beak, eye, and belly color.
- Make sure to press c to see the individual objects separately!
